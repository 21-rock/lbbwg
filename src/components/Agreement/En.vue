    <p class="mb-5 text-sm">Risk Warning</p>
    <p class="mb-5 text-sm">
      1. Digital assets involve significant risks, and there are many
      uncertainties in market trading. Additionally, due to the generally small
      market capitalization of digital currencies, prices are susceptible to
      substantial fluctuations influenced by market manipulation and government
      policies worldwide. Due to price volatility, you may experience
      significant gains or losses. Any digital asset can experience substantial
      fluctuations and may even become worthless.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5 text-sm">
      2. Due to the formulation or modification of laws, regulations, and
      normative documents in various countries, digital asset trading may be
      suspended or prohibited at any time. Users are advised to evaluate the
      risks based on local laws, regulations, and policy documents when using
      UZX services.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5 text-sm">
      3. Users participating in digital asset trading should carefully consider
      and evaluate the investment value and investment risks of digital assets
      based on their financial situation. Users should independently control
      trading risks and bear the economic risk of losing their entire
      investment.
